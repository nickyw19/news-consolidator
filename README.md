# Project:
Top News Aggregator Email

# Description:
This program extracts the top 5 headlines from various news sources (e.g. CNN, Forbes, etc) on a daily basis,
and aggregate them into a single email (with duplicates removed and replaced with unique headlines). The goal
is to bring recipients up-to-date on the latest news from multiple sources in a bite-sized manner.
